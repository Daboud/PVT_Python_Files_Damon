PATCH AND FEATURE SIZES
xlength0 = intended x length fo patch. Actual length will be slightly different depending on feature sizes
ylength0 = intended y length fo patch. Actual length will be slightly different depending on feature sizes
xmove = translate the stage after patch is finished this distance (mm). Useful for making many test patches in a row
hheight (or hexheight) = diameter of hexagonal features, at the shortest possible measurement (face to face)
pwidth = width of square pillars
holewidth = width of square holes
spacing = space between adjacent features
fatchage = use to adjust width of features if they are the wrong size
tallchage = use to adjust height of features if they are the wrong size

LASER PROPERTIES
scanv = scanning velocity of the laser beam / stage
depthcount = number of overscans
zdrill = depth of a single overscan
LW = line width of a single line
ol0 = intended overlap percentage. Actual value might vary slightly to make features just the right size
zdepth = total z travel during lasing, based on zdrill and depthcount
Angle = angle of sample wrt beam. flat sample = 0. 45o sample = math.pi/4
shuttertime = time for shutter open/close step. Should be 0.001 for SDG shutter or 0.008 for physical shutter
maxaccel = max acceleration of X and Y stages
Zmaxaccel = max acceleration of Z stage

TRIGONOMETRY
t60 = tan of 60o. Useful for hex features.
s60 = sine of 60o
c60 = cos of 60o
sa = sine of the sample's angle
ca = cose of the sample's angle
LWa = line width of the angled sample. This will be slightly higher than LW due to projection onto an extended surface

RASTER SCAN
Rtot = total distance covered by raster scanning in a single loop of code
Rshift0 = intended shift in beam position to achieve correct overlap %
Rshift = actual shift in beam position
Rshifty = shift in y stage (for angled surfaces Y and Z must work together to accomplish shift on plane of sample)
Rshiftz = shift in z stage
OLtrue = true overlap percentage
N0 = intended number of loops to accomplish above settings
N = actual number of loops (must be integer...)
Nh = loop count for hexes
Ns = loop count for spacing between features
Np = loop count for square pillars

DIMENSIONS
dx shift in x-position after each raster scan to create hexagonal pattern
xgap = feature spacing expressed wrt orientation of hex codes
UCwidth = width of a unit cell for hex codes
UCheight = height of a unit cell for hex codes
stripecount = number of unit cell repetitions in x direction
solidcount = number of unit cell repetitions in y direction
HexHeightTrue = true height of inscribed hex
SpacingWidthTrue = true spacing between features
shutterspace = physical travel distance of beam during a shutter opening event
bwidth = width of base of hexagon (one side)
hwidth (or hexwidth) = width of a hexagon, from corner to corner
pitch = pitch of features pattern
xlength = final width of patch
ylength = final height of patch

TIMING
flytime = time needed for the beam to 'fly back' to the starting x-position
flydist = space the beam must move back to start next raster scan in X
